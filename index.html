    <h1>"14 Point of QUAD-E-AZAM MUHAMMAD li JINNAH"</h1>

    <P>The Fourteen Points of <strong>JINNAH</strong>were proposed by <STRONG>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</STRONG> in response to the <EM> <strong>Nehru report</strong></EM> It consisted of four <strong>DELHI</strong> proposals, the three Calcutta amendments, demands for the continuation of separate electorates and reservation of seats for <strong>MUSLIMS</strong> in government services and self-governing bodies. In <strong>1982,</strong> an All Parties Conference was convened in reaction to the Simon Commission appointed to discuss parliamentary reform in British India. A committee was set up under Motilal Nehru which prepared the <STRONG>"Nehru Report".</STRONG> This report demanded <strong>"Dominion Status"</strong> for India. Separate electorates were refused and the reservation of seats for the <strong></strong>Muslims of Bengal and Punjab was rejected. The Nehru Report did not uphold a single demand of the Muslim League. In reaction to the Nehru Report, the League authorised Jinnah to draft in concise terms the basis of any future constitution for India. Jinnah aimed to safeguard the interests of Muslims. He gave his <strong>14</strong> points which covered the interests of Muslims and in these <STRONG>14</STRONG> points <EM>Jinnah</EM> stated it was the <STRONG>"parting of ways"</STRONG> and that he did not want anything to do with the Indian National Congress in the future. The League leaders motivated Jinnah to revive the Muslim League and give it direction. As a result, these points became the demands of the League and greatly influenced the Muslims' thinking for the next two decades until the <strong>establishment of Pakistan in 1947.</strong></P>
